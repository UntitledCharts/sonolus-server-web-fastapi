# sonolus-server-web-fastapi
Quick FastAPI application designed to serve a compiled /dist/ from https://github.com/Sonolus/sonolus-server-web

# Setup
1. Install python
2. Make a venv (recommended, optional)
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Move the compiled `/dist` folder to the project root
5. `python main.py` to serve (you can pair this with something like pm2!)
    - Alternatively, you can serve the app.py file directly.
